Execute as such:

python mdsearch.py 'path to testdata.csv file'
or if you have python 3 in path omit the python in the previous example

Notes:  may need to edit the file path attributes in the testdata.csv file to reflect their current location within the host  filesystem

also, requires python 3.x (latest) and PyQt5 to run
