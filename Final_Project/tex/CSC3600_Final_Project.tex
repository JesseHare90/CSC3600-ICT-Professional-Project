\section{3. Project Process}

\subsection{3.1 Team Organisation}
There were a total of 5 members in the USQ Learning Emporium group. As this project was initially designed for teams of 3, the group needed to strategise ways in which to split the work up. The first solution was to divide the main project task into 2 main groups; a back-end team (3 members) and a front-end team (2 members). Within these groups each member had different roles.

\subsection{3.2 Team Structure and Roles}
As stated above, the group was divided into 2 main groups;  a back-end team (3 members) and a front-end team (2 members). The back-end team consisted of: James McKeown (Team Leader), Richard Dobson (Programmer) and Vincent Roberts (Programmer) **needs to be fixed. The front-end team consisted of: Jesse Hare (Team Leader), Ryan Sharp (Programmer). \\

James McKeown and Jesse Hare both lead their respective teams. This allowed for clear and concise instructions (**expand on this). Both of these members took on the most technical aspects of the project, especially in regards to researching solutions. Other members then utilised this research to program their respective tasks within the project. \\


\subsection{3.3 Communication and Meetings}
The speed of communication between members was very quick and easy. Each member was responsive within the private Facebook Messenger group. This application was used as the main point of communication, especially when something urgent was needed. The group also decided to use a Slack channel for more technical and project related subjects. Slack was new to all members and was therefore not utilised to it's full potential. \\

The main problem faced with these text based messaging applications, was that information wasn't organised properly. Meaning, it would of been best it the group used the Slack channel as the main point of contact as it was organised properly. \\
